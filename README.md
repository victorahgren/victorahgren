- 👋 Hi, I’m @victorahgren - a Cyber security consultant with a background in penetration testing of web applicatioons, networks, (azure)AD, and just attacking in whatever way is suitable for the situation at hand.
- I also have a lot of experience as a kind of SOC engineer. I've built combinations of the whole Rapid7 package, IBM QRadar, Crowdstrike Falcon, Splunk, Sentinel and the list goes on...
- Doing incident response in said applications, but also using tools like wireshark, teleseer, QualysVM (which i kind of classify as more of an offensive tool, haha), Rapid7 also has a pretty good logging system, and querying anything always takes a bit of a learning cutve,
- however, when you're good at it, it is extremely effective.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, quantum physics, cryptography (which together with the quantum world will changet the world one day, mark my words!), penetration testing, programming/coding in Java, C, C++, Python (primarely atm), Golang, Ruby, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and the list goes on...
- Obviously i'm not an expert in all of these fields, but I like to learn technologies in all fields, although penetration testing is my darling, haha.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning & teaching penetration testing, networking, AI, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. At that point you'll probably need some university/college level skills of mathematics and physics. Espeacially regarding probabilities, matrices and things like Guass elimination etc...
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a penetration testint course for beginners to novice skilled people. I'm working with 4-5 people with a high level of cyber security skills in different areas. Halil Deniz here on Github is great friend and a dedicated worker, constantly pushing
- to learn and grow in the cyber realm, not to mention programming. https://github.com/HalilDeniz/
