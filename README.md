- 👋 Hi, I’m @victorahgren - a 34 year old, Swedish, Cyber security consultant with a background in penetration testing of web applicatioons, networks, (azure)AD, and just attacking in whatever way is suitable for the situation at hand.
- I also have a lot of experience as a kind of SOC engineer. I've built combinations of the whole Rapid7 package, IBM QRadar, Crowdstrike Falcon, Splunk, Sentinel and the list goes on...
- Doing incident response in said applications, but also using tools like wireshark, teleseer, QualysVM (which i kind of classify as more of an offensive tool, haha), Rapid7 also has a pretty good logging system, and querying anything always takes a bit of a learning curve,
- however, when you're good at it, it is extremely effective.
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, quantum physics, cryptography (which together with the quantum world will change the world one day, mark my words!), penetration testing, programming/coding in Java, C, C++, Python (primarely atm), Golang, Ruby, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and the list goes on...
- Obviously i'm not an expert in all of these fields, but I like to learn technologies in all fields, although penetration testing is my darling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning & teaching penetration testing, networking, AI, machine learning, deep learning and neural networks. At that point you'll probably need some university/college level skills of mathematics and physics. Espeacially regarding probabilities, matrices and things like Guass elimination etc...
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a penetration testing course for beginners to novice or even skilled people just wishing to brush up on some specific area, because let's face it - NO ONE is an expert at them all. I'm working with 4-5 people with a high level of cyber security skills in different areas. Halil Deniz here on Github is great friend and a dedicated worker, constantly pushing to learn and grow in the cyber realm, not to mention programming. https://github.com/HalilDeniz/

*As someone who's been doing everything from photoshop, after effects, 3D-modelling/rendering to web design, android application development along with the above mentioned more cyber security related things since I was 10-11, so... At 34, I feel I might have a duty to now publish my little creations here and there, when there's time, to contribute back to the community that has helped me so much!*

Best regards,

Victor Åhgren
